# Othello AI Agent (Python)

This project implements an intelligent Othello (Reversi) agent using the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Features:
- Full Othello game logic with move validation and piece flipping
- AI opponent using MiniMax search
- Alpha-Beta pruning for performance optimization
- Configurable search depth
- Simple graphical interface built with Tkinter

Technologies:
- Python
- Algorithms (MiniMax, Alpha-Beta pruning)
- Tkinter GUI

This project was developed as part of my Computer Science studies and focuses on algorithm design and decision-making systems.
